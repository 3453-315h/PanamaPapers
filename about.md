---

The Panama Papers is an [unprecedented investigation](https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160403-panama-papers-global-overview.html) that reveals the offshore links of some of the globe's most prominent figures.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), together with the German newspaper *Suddeutsche Zeitung* and more than 100 other media partners, including the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR), spent a year sifting through 11.5 million leaked files to expose the offshore holdings of world political leaders, links to global scandals, and details of the hidden financial dealings of fraudsters, drug traffickers, billionaires, celebrities, sports stars and more.
