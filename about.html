      <p><span class="drop-cap">C</span>ost Of Life is an international collaboration combining corporate data and extensive field reporting to expose the lie created by the pharmaceutical industry’s insistence that the costs and patents for the development of new drugs remain confidential. Our investigation will show how artificial costing is the ‘capitalisation’ of costs: that investment is valued at the expected return investors may forego during development, contrasted to financial securities or other equity portfolios.</p>
      
      <p> Our investigation will also show how the pharmaceutical industry uses tax havens and arms length pricing (ALP) to distort its accounting and reporting of intangible capital by claiming exceptional ‘assets’ that cannot be listed on the market due to lack of third party, external or other benchmarking </p>

      <p>The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists worked with 13 reporters from 13 countries in Africa. <a href="http://investigativecenters.org" target="_blank">The African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR)</a> provided important logistical, data and editorial support.</p>

      <p>It is one of the largest ever collaborations of African journalists.</p>
