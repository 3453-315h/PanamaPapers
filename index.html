        <h1 class="section-title">Pharmaceutical Tax Optimisation Strategies</h1>

        <p>R&D costs are shifted to high tax jurisdictions to offset costs … while profits generated by patents are often "re-located" to low-tax jurisdictions. Tax credits (such as subsidies etc) amount to an average of 40% of the cost of R&D, according to the US’s Office of Technology Assessment.</p>

        <p>This tax optimisation strategy closely resembles that of "high-tech" companies depending on intangible capital for the bulk of their wealth. Pfizer, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline - as well as over 60 per cent of Fortune 500 multinationals, all maintain entities in Delaware, taking full advantage of legal and financial opacity tools.</p>
