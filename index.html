        <h1 class="section-title">Pharmaceutical Tax Optimisation Strategies</h1>

        <p>R&D costs are shifted to high tax jurisdictions to offset costs … while profits generated by patents are often "re-located" to low-tax jurisdictions. Tax credits (such as subsidies etc) amount to an average of 40% of the cost of R&D, according to the US’s Office of Technology Assessment.</p>

        <p>This tax optimisation strategy closely resembles that of "high-tech" companies depending on intangible capital for the bulk of their wealth. Pfizer, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline - as well as over 60 per cent of Fortune 500 multinationals, all maintain entities in Delaware, taking full advantage of legal and financial opacity tools.</p>

        <p>In addition to banking secrecy and zero disclosure of beneficial owners, Delaware allows for parent companies to establish holding companies within two days, producing nothing, conducting no economic activity in the state, and generally hosting just one shareholder (the parent company). Such entities, allowing the parent company to pay the newly created entity a "fee" for use of IP, serves as a passive conduit converting taxable income to passive non-taxable profit.</p>
        
        <p>The entity's sole purpose is to own and 'manage' laundered income generated from IP. The result is a highly illicit political economy designed to misrepresent the actual costs of the life-saving drugs in order to drain  citizen budgets (whether directly or through taxpayer funds) with devastating outcomes.</p>
